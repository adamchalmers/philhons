Philosophy of Happiness essay plan

Intro
 - What is welfare?

Haybron welfare
 - Standard Haybron welfare theory
 - Other fulfilment types and welfare goods

Nonhuman welfare
 - Analyse each type of creature and which welfare goods it can receive
 - Animals
 - Plants
 - Ecosystems
 - Aliens
 - Robots
 - Groups (health is group existence but unclear whether moral right. Clearly has some importance, look at the preservation of a political party, company or the UN).

Problems
 - Could desire, mental state or hedonist theories serve better?
 - Could Aristotelian theories serve better?
 - What is a nature? Do rocks have a nature? Why not? Are you committing to panpsychism?
 - Welfare aggregation and comparison
 - Partial ordering

Rock welfare
 - Yes, rocks have welfare, it consists in not being smashed up.
 - Bite the bullet
 - Only problem with this is that welfare is no longer action-guiding or ethically concerned.
 - Ethical theory requires saying which welfares are and aren't valuable.
 - BEING is the minimal welfare
