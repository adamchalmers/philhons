The philosophy honours thesis written by Adam Chalmers at University of Sydney.

This thesis is about decision theory, a field of study jointly owned by philosophy, mathematics and economics. Decision theory is the study of how to decide. It provides mathematical guides for which choice to make in a certain situation. Decision theory is very successful, and often people think it's a solved problem. But there are some problems (such as Pascal’s Wager, the St. Petersburg Paradox, and Pascal’s Mugging) in which standard decision theory provides bad advice. My thesis looks at what these problems have in common, *why* decision theory does so poorly on them, and how to improve decision theory to handle these problems better.

This thesis was awarded first class honours and the John Anderson Prize for Best Thesis in Philosophy IV at the University of Sydney in 2016.
