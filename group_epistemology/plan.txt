Group Rationality essay

Goal: evaluate premise-based procedures as a solution to the Group Credence Problem. 

Essay Plan (4 to 5 thousand words)

Introduction (500)
 - What is group epistemology?
 - How does it differ to individual epistemology?
 - Why isn't it straightforward?

Introduce premise-based procedures (500)
 - Outline L&P
 - Outline Probabilistic Opinion Pooling (POP)

Evaluate POP (600 each?)
 - Violates many L&P impossibility conditions. Is this good or bad?
 - Elephant problem
 - How do you choose premises? (Kolgomorov? Pearl causality?)
 - Evidentialism - does POP ignore evidence problems? Lackey's guards?
 - Once you have your premise credences, how do you move forward to conclusion credences? Whose probability function do you use? Average them? Universal Prior?

Conclusion (1000)
 - Summarise the evaluation - overall good or bad?
 - Ways to improve it? Build in group evidence?




But while it may not always be possible to know what beliefs and credences a group ought to have, this does not mean that such knowledge is never, or even rarely, possible.

Should norms for group belief be like norms for ind belief or like group pref? 
My arg: structural difference between pref and belief like zero point, boundlessness, objective correctness conditions

pg. 230: wisdom of the crowds fails because you can't assume Just Above Random Chance accuracy for votes. Think about the elephant and blind men. People shouldn't assign 51% to Elephant and 49% to Not-Elephant. Not-Elephant is a disjunctive and far simpler hypothesis. Putting Elephant on the ballot is privileging the hypothesis. This is why WOC fails - most ballots are disjunctive in some way. X or Not-X is always massively weighted towards Not-X.
